# Lab 5 (Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard and Spock)

This is my submission for Centralized and Decentralized Finance class of 2024 (204496/219493), Department of Computer Engineering, Kasetsart University.

## Included in the Repo
### `/contracts`
* `RPS.sol` - the contract containing the Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock game
* `TimeUnit.sol` - the contract containing TimeUnit (records timestamps)
* `CommitReveal.sol` - the contract containing CommitReveal (used to prevent front-running)
### `/test`
* `RPS.ts` â€” test file for `RPS.sol`, will not work unless player restriction logic in `addPlayer()` in `RPS.sol` is removed.
* For grading, you can ignore `/test` along with other files in the root directory.

## How It Works
### `RPS.sol`
We will define an enum `GamePhase` along with a state `gamePhase` that helps keeping track of the game's state. The details are as shown in the accompanying comments.
```solidity
enum GamePhase {
    WAITING, // Waiting for players
    COMMIT, // Waiting for two players to commit
    REVEAL, // Waiting for two players to reveal
    END // Game ended (probably unused)
  }

GamePhase public gamePhase;
```
The states above can be described by this basic state diagram.
```
             2 players joined            2 players commited            2 players revealed
--> WAITING -----------------> COMMIT ---------------------> REVEAL -----------------------
       ^                         |  no players left            |  no players left         |
       |                         v                             v                          |
       ------------------------- o <-------------------------- o <-------------------------
```
The game starts in the `WAITING` state. During this state, players can call `addPlayer()` to join the game.
```solidity
// Adds a player to the game
// Players must provide 1 ETH to join the game
// Only permitted players can join the game (refer to the 4-line require statement)
function addPlayer() public payable {
    require(!playerInGame[msg.sender], "Already joined");
    require(numPlayers < 2, "Too many players");
    require(
      gamePhase == GamePhase.WAITING,
      "Cannot join when the game has started"
    );
}
```
